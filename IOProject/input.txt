The list of Korean nominees for the 2024 edition of the distinguished international children's literature awards was announced on Saturday.

Writer Lee Geum-yi and illustrator Kwon Yoon-duck have been nominated for the 2024 Hans Christian Andersen Award (HCAA), according to the Korean Board on Books for Young People (KBBY).

Also referred to as the "Little Nobel Prize," the HCAA is the highest international recognition given by the International Board on Books for Young People (IBBY) to both an author and an illustrator for their lifelong contributions to children's literature. Named in honor of the 19th-century Danish author of celebrated fairy tales, the prize is awarded biennially based on the unique aesthetic and literary qualities of the nominees' body of works, after each country's branch of the IBBY recommends its candidates.
